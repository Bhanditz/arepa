Arepa
=====

Arepa (Apt REPository Assistant) is a suite of tools to manage a Debian
package repository. It consists of command-line tools and a web interface.

To configure the web interface, you'll have to make web/cgi/arepa.cgi
available somewhere (as well as the CSS) and configure /etc/arepa/config.yml
appropriately (there's a sample config file named config.yml-sample).

You must also add this line to your sudo configuration:

 %arepa ALL = (arepa-master) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/arepa sign
