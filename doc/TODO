* Tell Espen to release the module on CPAN
* Make a Debian package out of Parse-Debian-PackageDesc so it can be installed,
  arepa can depend on it, and work on the arepa Debian package can start
* Create the postinst scripts so /var/arepa/gnupg-web is created on package
  installation (see --list-keys and the contents of the default option file
  inside it)
* Create a default keyring with the Opera key, and make it part of the
  distribution (use it for the initial /var/arepa/keyring/uploaders.gpg)
* Figure out some permissions for package.db that work for both www-data and
  arepa-master. Should package.db be created by default as an empty database?
* Create some directory /var/arepa/upload-queue for the default upload queue
  and appropriate permissions
* See if there's any way that other users can use sbuild and stuff: maybe
  creating the directories as arepa-master:sbuild or similar, and giving group
  permissions too, and documenting that the user must be member of the sbuild
  group
* Think about the signing the release files (gpg -abs -o Release.gpg Release)
  and automatic rsync'ing to another host. Keys should be the ones for
  arepa-master, but the repository will have to be kept writable by both
  www-data and arepa-master
