* Create the postinst scripts so /var/arepa/gnupg-web is created on package
  installation (see --list-keys and the contents of the default option file
  inside it)
* Create a default keyring with the Opera key, and make it part of the
  distribution (use it for the initial /var/arepa/keyring/uploaders.gpg)
* Figure out some permissions for package.db that work for both www-data and
  arepa-master. Should package.db be created by default as an empty database?
* Create some directory /var/arepa/upload-queue for the default upload queue
  and appropriate permissions
* See if there's any way that other users can use sbuild and stuff: maybe
  creating the directories as arepa-master:sbuild or similar, and giving group
  permissions too, and documenting that the user must be member of the sbuild
  group. PROBABLY SCREW IT, LOGIN AS arepa-master.

* The user, after installation, will have to "su - arepa-master" and create a
  new GPG key for it. The secret key ID should be in the configuration
* Also, how is the default repository going to be created? Maybe simply create
  a default /var/arepa/repository/conf/distributions with a default "squeeze"
  distribution or something similar?

* Make www-data be part of a new group, arepa. That group should be the group
  for all the interesting directories, and those directories should have the
  gid bit set.
* Have to set the umask to 0002 to reprepro creates the files with the
  appropriate permissions

* EVERY TIME A PACKAGE IS PUT INTO THE REPO, IT HAS TO BE SIGNED AGAIN. That
  way, further packages that build-depend on it can be downloaded and compiled
