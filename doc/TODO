* Figure out how are the GPG signatures being checked now
* Create the postinst scripts so the /var/arepa/keyrings and whatever are
  created on package installation (see also --list-keys to create the initial
  /var/arepa/gnupg-web directory, and the contents of the default option file
  inside it)
* Really rename Parse-Debian-Changes to Parse-Debian-PackageDesc (the .pm
  itself)
* Tell Espen to release the module on CPAN
* Make a Debian package out of it so it can be installed, arepa can depend on
  it, and work on the arepa Debian package can start
* Figure out some permissions for package.db that work for both www-data and
  arepa-master. Should package.db be created by default as an empty database?
